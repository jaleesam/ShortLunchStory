            You Chose: Gluten Free Perogies!
    </h3>
           
    <p>
            You have gained a little bit a weight recently and sitting in front of a computer coding non stop has not been 
            completely helpful in reaching your weight loss goals. But hey you may still be craving carbs despite wanting to start 
            living the gluten-free lifestyle.

    <p>
            You eat the perogies, give yourself a pat on the back for making a “healthy” decision and 
            go back to writing some more code. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
            But really seriously are gluten free perogies really all that healthy?
